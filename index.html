                    The line between unclean and clean is much more than a standard. If you want to make sure your house is truly clean, then you need the extra help of professional cleaners who really know what they are doing. One of these services is air duct cleaning in Houston. There are several factors that affect the total cost for this type of service, which include:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul style="padding-left: 50px;">   
                    <li>
                        <h3>Number Of Units</h3><br>
                        <p>Typically, an average-sized home can be cleaned within 2-3 hours by one team. However, if the home has 4 or more units (ideally around 5) it may require two separate teams working together at once in order to speed up the process and prevent excessive time spent on any single unit. If there are only 3 units, again an additional team may be assigned in order to reduce the total time spent in the home. With every additional unit above 3, whether it is 4 or 5 or even 6, an extra team should be added in order to ensure efficiency and prevent excessive time spent on any single unit.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>Number Of Stories</h3><br>
                        <p>Cleaning air ducts run by gravity doesn't take much strength. However, if the home has more stories, then it will take longer to transport all of that dirt down through each floor below it. If this is the case, then there may need to be one or two more teams assigned than usual. In some cases, a single unit with many floors can take as long as two hours due to the fact that they must travel back and forth between floors several times in order to collect all of the dirt.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Length Of Time Needed For Cleaning</h3><br>
                        <p>As already addressed, more time will be needed for homes with more stories, which means that houses with many floors or large units are likely to pay higher rates than average size units. A house with only 2 floors is much more reasonable for one team to clean in a reasonable amount of time while still getting everything done thoroughly.</p>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Time of the Year</h3><br>
                        <p>During the summer months when it's hot outside, air conditioners are working constantly and used religiously. This means that there is an increase in the number of people using their ACs, which results in increased levels of dust throughout your home since most people won't open their windows due to fear of pests, and there is no breeze to blow the dust outside. Because of this, air duct cleaning in Houston becomes a very popular choice during the summer months as people tend to use their ACs more often and they become increasingly dirtier as time goes on without proper cleaning. Winter rates drop for this service because most homeowners tend to use their heater less frequently than their ACs, as it's too cold outside. The result is that homeowners aren't changing or moving their filters as much since they only change them when they start noticing a decrease in performance due to dirtiness. This results in ultimately cleaner systems with less dust throughout the home and will require less attention from cleaners during the wintertime than in the summertime.</p>

                        <h2>
                            What To Consider When Cleaning
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Many people have allergies and while many struggles through the symptoms, some become so bad that they require medical attention to get things under control. If a person has a sensitivity to dust or other particles floating around in the air, then it is important that they take extra precautions to ensure their home is as clean as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of these steps includes changing the filters on their heating and cooling units at least twice per season for maximum efficiency. In addition, opening windows once a week will allow for cross airflow which can keep the unit from becoming too clogged up with dirt over time. If you suffer this type of ailment, then it’s also a good idea to avoid spending time outside during heavy winds since there will be more pollen blowing around and more dust carried on the wind.
                        </p>

                <h2>
                    The Benefits of Having Your Air Ducts Cleaned Regularly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important reason to get your air ducts cleaned regularly is the fact that this will improve the quality of air in your home, which can significantly increase energy efficiency. Having a professional Houston Air Duct Cleaning company come out and clean the air ducts in your home ensures that all of your HVAC components are operating at maximum performance without huge amounts of dust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This results in more efficient use of energy while everyone benefits from cleaner breathing air at all times. In addition, people with allergies will find their symptoms drastically reduced after having their units professionally cleaned since there will be less pollen and other particles floating around in the home. The bottom line is that regular cleaning results in healthier homes for occupants and higher levels of overall energy efficiency.

                <h2>
                    When Is It Time To Have Your Air Ducts Cleaned?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people only think about getting their units cleaned when they start noticing a drop off in the heat or airflow throughout the house. If this is happening, then it’s time to get your units checked out by a professional company because there are likely serious issues that need to be fixed before they can cause more damage to your system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, many homeowners don’t notice these signs until the dropping efficiency levels become too much for them to ignore. At this point, you will find huge amounts of dust throughout your home with dirt everywhere and potentially even mold forming due to excessive moisture build-up on the vents. These problems not only cause reduced efficiency but also health concerns for everyone living in the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, regular cleaning is recommended as a preventative measure against these issues so that you can avoid them altogether and find higher energy efficiency with cleaner airflow throughout your home.

                <h2>
                    What Are The Costs Associated With Air Duct Cleaning?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It’s important to ask this question before having any work done on your units because there are many companies out there offering extremely low rates for these services, which makes it seem like it won’t be much of an additional cost. However, if they aren’t charging enough, then they are likely cutting corners in order to keep their costs down. This means sub-par quality service that isn’t necessarily safe for you or your family at all times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means that you need to do your research and find a company that has the skill-set and the tools to do the job right while staying within your budget. If you can’t afford to hire an actual professional company, then some Houston residents turn to rent one of those powerful vacuum cleaners with a hose attachment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this does help clean out some dust from the vents, it’s not going to remove all of the dirt like a skilled technician will be able to do during an extensive cleaning process. Additionally, you need to pay attention if there is any water damage in your system because there is likely mold growth on top of just regular dirt and debris.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Choose to Use a Vacuum Cleaner in Order to ensure that All of the Dust is Removed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One downside to using a vacuum cleaner instead of having someone come out and use some industrial-strength tools to do it for you is that you will likely leave behind some extra dirt. The cleaning process with vacuums simply involves sucking up dirt, which means there still could be particles floating around in your ducts. This isn’t necessarily dangerous but it can lead to reduced efficiency levels because all of this excess dust gets re-distributed into the air when your HVAC system turns on again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a professional service ensures that all of this dust is removed so there are no negative effects to your system in the future when you need it most. These cleaners do everything from removing dirt and debris to sanitizing your entire system with special chemicals, which means they will be able to address any potential problems with mold growth as well.
